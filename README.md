In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures, I'll demonstrate the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.

I'll also show about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.
